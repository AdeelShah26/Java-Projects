# Java-Projects
Here, I have uploaded my java projects.

1) Rock Paper and Scissor --> This is my first project in java, in this project I have made a game of rock paper and scissor which uses random package. 
This program declares the winner on best of 5 games played. If the final result is a tie then the program asks user to input 5 times(rock, paper or scissor) and ends when a winner is declared.
statements used --> for , do-while, if-else-if
